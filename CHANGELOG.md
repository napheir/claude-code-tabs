# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] -- 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- ASCII-only `.ps1` source — non-ASCII characters (em-dash, arrow, box-drawing) in scripts caused `windows-latest` GitHub Actions runner (English-locale PowerShell 5.1) to fail parsing with `TerminatorExpectedAtEndOfString` errors. Local Chinese-locale machines decoded the UTF-8 source correctly and didn't surface the bug. Replaced all non-ASCII with ASCII equivalents.
- BOM-prefixed stdin handling — when a parent process pipes UTF-8-with-BOM into a hook script (PowerShell native pipe between two PS5.1 processes does this), the leading `U+FEFF` made `ConvertFrom-Json` silently return null. `session_id` then fell back to `$PID` and the watcher's liveness check immediately deleted the entry. All hooks now strip the BOM before parsing.
- `tests/smoke.ps1` — reworked to use PowerShell native pipe + array splatting instead of `Start-Process -RedirectStandardInput / -ArgumentList`. The `Start-Process` approach failed in two ways on PS5.1: stdin redirection didn't reliably reach the child, and `-ArgumentList` did not preserve quoting around args containing spaces (`-Message 'Task complete'` was sent as `-Message Task` + positional `complete`).

## [0.1.0] -- 2026-04-30

Initial public release. Extracted from a private multi-Agent project where the panel had been dogfooded for several weeks.

### Added
- 5 hook scripts (`notify-busy`, `notify-done`, `notify-clear`, `notify-resume`, `agent-tabs-watcher`).
- `install.ps1` with `-DryRun`, `-SkipStartup`, `-Update`, `-Uninstall` flags.
- Idempotent merge into `~/.claude/settings.json` (preserves user's other hook entries; SHA256-based file copy skip).
- Startup folder shortcut for auto-launch on login.
- Per-tab dedup via `terminal_pid` (parent process walk; current `$PID` is the short-lived hook process and is never used as the tab identity).
- Liveness check: drops status entries whose owning shell pid has died (= tab closed).
- Taskbar flash with foreground guard (no-op flash on currently-focused host window).
- Window title prefix (`[OK]` / `[WAIT]` / `[!]`).
- Toast notification with cwd-basename suffix (`Claude Code - my-project`).
- WAIT → BUSY auto-recovery on `PreToolUse`.
- UTF-8 stdin force in every hook (PowerShell 5.1 default GBK / cp936 corrupts CC's UTF-8 hook payload — Chinese / Unicode prompts in particular).

### Known limitations
- Windows-only (WinForms-bound panel; `Win32` `FlashWindowEx` etc.).
- Multi-tab terminal hosts (Windows Terminal / Tabby) share one `MainWindowHandle` across all tabs — the panel can bring the host window to front on double-click but cannot focus a specific tab inside it.
- Tested with Claude Code only. Other AI CLIs likely use different stdin payload schemas (`sessionId` camelCase vs `session_id` snake_case, etc.) — see `docs/architecture.md` for details.
